### Requirements

[jruby][jruby] it is important that `jruby` is on your `path` preferably `/usr/bin/jruby` (you can create a symbolic link if your install method does not do it for you)

Install jdk-11+

Install jruby-9.2.6.0+

### Install from rubygems
```bash
jruby -S gem install math_demo
# or
jgem install math_demo
# or if default ruby is jruby
gem install math_demo
```

Congratulation you have installed [propane][propane] a standalone version of `ruby-processing`, compiled with jdk11

### How do I run it?

```bash
math_demo
# or to be safe
jruby -S math_demo
```

### What's happening

Three random moving particles are created (they are restricted to moving in the frame). The display is the outline of an ellipse (circle) that is a circumcircle. That is circle that goes through three points given by the particles position. The color of the circle, changes gradually, apart from being constrained (by the frame) the points also sometimes change direction randomly. Periodically the whole sketch is refreshed.

### Why?

This is very much a taster of what can be done with [propane][propane], a batteries included ruby-wrapper for processing-3.3.6. See more [examples here][examples]
