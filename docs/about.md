 It is possible to harness the [atom editor][atom] to create a [github project][project]. Here we create a ruby project that uses [propane][propane] to access processing graphics to create a maths demo. You can even run minitest and the propane sketch, without leaving the atom editor if you install the [script package][script]. Hell you can even preview the markdown.
